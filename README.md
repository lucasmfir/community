A simple turorial from [howtographql](https://www.howtographql.com/) for a Graphql and Elixir application with Absinthe.

To start your Phoenix server:

* Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
* Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit the Graphql playground in [`localhost:4000/graphiql`](http://localhost:4000/graphiql) from your browser.
